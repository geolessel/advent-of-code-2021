# Advent of Code 2021

This year I've decided to try everything in a Phoenix Livebook. To run
this, you'll first need to make sure Livebook is installed. I've done
it via the [Escript
instructions](https://github.com/livebook-dev/livebook#escript) in the
Livebook README.

Start a Livebook session in this directory and visit the URL spit out
by the server.

```shell
cd $THIS_DIRECTORY
liveview server
```
